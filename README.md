## User Stories

### Home page section
* I want a home page with the game name so I understand what the site is about.
* I want to see game play options so that I can have an idea of where to navigate.

### The Game
* I want the game to generate random math sums so that I can expect a different math question every round.
* I want the game to end after 20 questions so that I don't get bored. 
* I want to know how many correct answers I got so I can review my performance.
* I want to be able to switch between Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide modes so that can improve their knowledge in all four areas.
* I want to be able to restart the game so that I can try again if I get distracted.
